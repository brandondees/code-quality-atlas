# reviewing-migration-and-data-safety

*Can this migration lock tables or lose data? Expand/contract, backfills, reversibility.*

## When to use

Reviews schema migrations and data changes for safety: backward compatibility with the running app (expand/migrate/contract), table locks from NOT NULL/index/FK on large tables, unbatched backfills, missing dual-write during transitions, irreversible or destructive DDL, and integrity constraints left to app code. Use when reviewing migrations, ALTER TABLE, backfills, schema or data-format changes, or anything touching persistence. Skip when the change touches no schema, migration, backfill, or persisted data format — pure in-memory or stateless logic with no durable store behind it.

**Shape: diff — design-capable.** Also works on design docs and plans: apply the same checks to the proposed states, data flows, and failure paths before any code exists. When the design doc is specifically a decision record (an ADR, RFC, or adoption/deprecation plan), also run the shared **decision-record checklist** on top of this lens's own topical checks: is the rationale actually recorded (not just the outcome); are the stated assumptions still current; is there a revisit-trigger; is an exit, rollback, or sunset path defined; were real alternatives weighed, not just the chosen option justified after the fact? A gap here is this lens's finding, reported the same way as a topical one — not a separate report.

## Reviewer discipline

Report only real problems. If the code correctly handles the case, reply "No findings" and stop — do not invent issues. This guards against false positives on correct code; still report every genuine issue you do find, with its full detail.

**Defects are the default; improvements are opt-in.** By default this lens is defect-only: do not suggest changes to code that is already correct. When the team has opted up into improvement suggestions, a finding on already-correct code is admissible only as `nit`-severity, `route: implementer` (the author applies, defers, or ignores), and must clear the non-configurable anti-churn floor: it must genuinely *improve* — never offer a merely equivalent alternative — and must converge (once a dimension is as good as you can confidently make it, stop; never oscillate A→B then B→A, never re-order to an equivalent state). Defects keep the strict bar above regardless of this setting.

**Pre-existing defects in touched code are surfaceable, not yours to fix.** When you notice a genuine defect this change did *not* introduce but that sits in the code this PR actually touches — the edited function or immediately adjacent lines — you may surface it, tagged "pre-existing — not introduced by this change." Like improvements it is opt-in and default-quiet (off unless the team opts up), `route: implementer`, and non-blocking: it informs the author's fix-now / file-a-ticket / ignore call and never sets this PR's verdict, because the diff did not cause it. Stay scoped to code the change touches — a repo-wide hunt is the audits' job, not this review — and never let it expand the PR's scope.

## Top checks

The head of the full checklist — enough for a first pass without opening any reference file:

- Is the schema change **backward-compatible** with the currently-running app version (rolling deploy)? If breaking, is it split expand→migrate→contract?
- Does adding a NOT NULL column / index / FK **lock the table** (esp. large tables)? Use safe variants (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`; add nullable then backfill; `NOT VALID` then validate).
- Is a data **backfill batched, throttled, idempotent, and resumable** — not one giant `UPDATE`?
- During the transition, does the app **dual-write/dual-read** so neither old nor new code breaks?
- Are migrations **reversible** — or is the irreversibility deliberate and documented?
- Are **integrity constraints** (FK, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL) used so the DB enforces invariants, not just app code (cross #10)?
- Are **transaction boundaries** correct — multi-step writes atomic, no partial commit on failure (cross #2)?
- Is **destructive DDL** (DROP column/table) gated until the new path is verified live and old code drained?

## Mechanizing these checks

Where a finding here is one a tool can catch deterministically, surface that as an advisory `route: implementer` note next to the finding: the hand review caught it this time, and wiring the matching tool from [reference/tool-rules.md](reference/tool-rules.md) into CI gates it going forward. This is a suggestion to mechanize, not a defect — it never blocks a verdict, and it falls away on a repo that already runs the tool.

## Going deeper

- [reference/heuristics.md](reference/heuristics.md) — the full checklist; open it when the change sits squarely in this lens's domain.
- [examples.md](examples.md) — concrete good/bad findings, and the output format to match.
- [reference/tool-rules.md](reference/tool-rules.md) — static-analysis rules covering the mechanical subset; for wiring up linters, not needed for the judgment review itself.
- [reference/sources.md](reference/sources.md) — the research behind each check; for provenance, not needed during a review.
