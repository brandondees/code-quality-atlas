### Reviewable heuristics (skill-checklist seeds)

- Is the new dependency **necessary**, or could stdlib/a few lines do it (avoid trivial deps and transitive bloat)?
- Is it **healthy**: recently maintained, broadly used, reasonable Scorecard, not single-maintainer abandonware?
- Any **known CVEs** in it or its transitive tree (run the scanner)? Is the version **pinned via lockfile** and honored in CI (`npm ci`)?
- Does it pull in a large transitive subtree or **duplicate** an existing dependency's capability?
- License **compatible** with the project (cross #27)?
- Does the install run scripts or request network/filesystem access it shouldn't (malicious-package surface)?
- Are updates **automated** (Dependabot/Renovate) with the lockfile committed and enforced?
- Version bump → are breaking changes reviewed (changelog), especially across a major version?
- **Vendor lock-in**: does this couple us to a proprietary API where a standard/portable option exists?

### Reviewable heuristics (skill-checklist seeds)

- **New dependency license check:** does an added dependency (and its transitive tree) carry a license compatible with the project's distribution model? Block/strongly-flag GPL/AGPL pulled into a permissive or proprietary product.
- **Copyleft contamination / linkage:** does the change *link* or *combine* with copyleft code in a way that triggers obligations (esp. AGPL over a network service)? Static vs. dynamic linking and "mere aggregation" matter — flag for legal if unsure.
- **License/attribution preservation:** are upstream license texts, copyright notices, and NOTICE files retained when vendoring/copying code? Removed attribution = violation.
- **Provenance of copied code:** does this diff include code pasted from Stack Overflow, a blog, another repo, or AI generation without attribution/license clarity? Treat as untrusted: verify license, run secret/IP scan, label it.
- **Per-file license header:** do new source files have an `SPDX-License-Identifier` + copyright (REUSE)? Missing header = provenance gap.
- **PII data-flow:** does new code collect, store, log, or transmit personal data? If so — lawful basis/consent present, **minimized** to what's needed, not logged in plaintext, and not sent to a third party/region without basis (cross-links #14, #16, #25).
- **Retention & deletion:** is there a retention limit and an erasure path for new personal data (right-to-be-forgotten), or does it accumulate indefinitely?
- **Data residency / cross-border:** does the change move PII to a new region, vendor, or third-party model (incl. LLM APIs) — is that transfer permitted and documented? (cross-links #25 PII-to-model.)
- **Consent & purpose:** for new tracking/telemetry/analytics, is consent gating in place and is use limited to the stated purpose? No silent expansion of data use.
- **Accessibility-as-legal:** for regulated/consumer surfaces, does the change keep WCAG 2.x AA conformance (cross-links #23) given its legal weight?
- **Export / sanctions / crypto constraints:** does new cryptography, or distribution to restricted regions, hit export-control or compliance obligations? Flag for review (don't assume).
- **SBOM currency:** if dependencies changed, is the SBOM / license inventory regenerated so provenance stays accurate?
