# reviewing-a-decision

## When to use

Review a decision rather than code — an ADR, RFC, design doc, dependency or technology adoption, build-vs-buy or vendor choice, or a deprecation/sunset plan. Reviews the choice and its record (rationale, lock-in, exit, revisit trigger) with the decision lens plus the design-capable lenses for the decision's domain.

## How this works

Rank the relevant lenses below by relevance to what is being reviewed, pick the breadth from the depth mode (default **review**), then for each selected lens **load its bundle** and apply it:

- Read `reference/lenses/<lens>/body.md` — the lens's checklist and examples. Open `reference/lenses/<lens>/tool-rules.md` or `sources.md` only if deeper tooling/provenance is called for.
- After the lenses run, merge their findings with the procedure in `reference/synthesis.md` — one deduplicated, ranked report with a single verdict.

## Depth modes

Routing first ranks **every** lens whose scope the change touches by **relevance** — it is no longer a hard 2-4 cap. A depth mode then sets the **breadth** (how far down the ranked list to run) and the severity floor. Pick the mode from the request; default to **review**.

| Mode | Breadth | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| **triage** | the critical tier only — correctness, security, data-safety, and concurrency | "triage", "quick review", "fast check", "pre-merge gate" |
| **review** | the top 2-4 lenses by relevance (the default; overridable) | "review", "review this", "code review", "review this PR", "review the diff" |
| **comprehensive** | every relevant lens, uncapped — the full audit set at repo scope | "thorough", "comprehensive", "deep review", "use all relevant lenses", "review everything" |

- **triage** — A pre-merge gate: run only the critical-tier lenses and report Major and above.
- **review** — Default per-PR depth: relevance-ranked top-N with the round-based escalating floor.
- **comprehensive** — On-demand or scheduled: run all relevant lenses and pin the floor at Nit so readability-class and other long-tail findings surface instead of being trimmed.

| Change to an AI-/agent-maintained codebase, to agent-onboarding files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, llms.txt) or repo structure an agent must navigate, or a large/scattered change whose context economy matters | `checking-restraint` |
| User-facing flow that could manipulate or disadvantage a person — consent / opt-out, defaults, pricing or eligibility conditionals, onboarding / checkout / cancellation funnels | `sweeping-for-security` |
| Logging, metrics, alerts, feature flags, deploy/rollback paths | `reviewing-observability-and-operability`, `sweeping-for-security` |

| Change that parses or emits a standard format or speaks an external protocol — an HTTP/REST client or handler, an OAuth/OIDC or other auth flow, date / URL / email / CSV / JSON serialization, a version bump on a published surface, a cron expression, or telemetry attributes | `reviewing-api-contract-safety`, `tracing-correctness-and-invariants` |
| Infrastructure-as-code change (Terraform/OpenTofu, Kubernetes/Helm, CloudFormation manifests) | `sweeping-for-security` |
| A decision, not a diff — an ADR / RFC / design doc, a dependency or technology adoption, a build-vs-buy or vendor choice, or a deprecation / sunset plan | `reviewing-decision-lifecycle`, `checking-restraint`, `reviewing-api-contract-safety` |

## Lenses

◆ = design-capable.

- [`hunting-silent-failures`](reference/lenses/hunting-silent-failures/body.md) ◆ — Where do errors vanish? Swallowed exceptions, silent fallbacks, missing timeouts and retries.
- [`reviewing-module-design`](reference/lenses/reviewing-module-design/body.md) ◆ — Are the boundaries right? Coupling, encapsulation, interfaces that are hard to misuse, illegal states unrepresentable.
- [`checking-restraint`](reference/lenses/checking-restraint/body.md) ◆ — Is this change too much? Premature abstraction or optimization — the brake pedal.
- [`reviewing-llm-integration`](reference/lenses/reviewing-llm-integration/body.md) ◆ — Is the model call safe and bounded? Injection surface, output validation, evals, token cost, PII.
- [`reviewing-agentic-safety`](reference/lenses/reviewing-agentic-safety/body.md) ◆ — Is the agent's action surface safe? Tool least-privilege, approval gates & step budgets, untrusted tool metadata, sandboxed exec, egress control.
- [`reviewing-threat-model`](reference/lenses/reviewing-threat-model/body.md) ◆ — Enumerate what an adversary could do, boundary by boundary — STRIDE, trust boundaries, abuse cases — and whether each threat is mitigated.
- [`sweeping-for-security`](reference/lenses/sweeping-for-security/body.md) ◆ — Can an attacker abuse this? Injection, authorization, secrets, crypto, untrusted data.
- [`reviewing-performance-and-efficiency`](reference/lenses/reviewing-performance-and-efficiency/body.md) ◆ — Will this be slow or expensive at scale? N+1, O(n²) hot paths, caching, payload buffering.
- [`reviewing-migration-and-data-safety`](reference/lenses/reviewing-migration-and-data-safety/body.md) ◆ — Can this migration lock tables or lose data? Expand/contract, backfills, reversibility.
- [`tracing-correctness-and-invariants`](reference/lenses/tracing-correctness-and-invariants/body.md) ◆ — Does the code do what it claims? Invariants, boundaries, off-by-one, resource cleanup.
- [`reviewing-concurrency-and-async`](reference/lenses/reviewing-concurrency-and-async/body.md) ◆ — What breaks when two run at once? Races, lost updates, unawaited promises, idempotency.
- [`reviewing-api-contract-safety`](reference/lenses/reviewing-api-contract-safety/body.md) ◆ — Will this break a consumer? Compatibility, error contracts, idempotency, pagination.
- [`reviewing-observability-and-operability`](reference/lenses/reviewing-observability-and-operability/body.md) ◆ — Can you debug this in production at 3am? Logs, traces, health checks, kill switches, rollback.
- [`reviewing-decision-lifecycle`](reference/lenses/reviewing-decision-lifecycle/body.md) — Is this decision sound and recorded? Adoption justification, lock-in/exit, ADR assumptions, revisit-triggers, planned retirement.
- [`reviewing-resilience-and-scalability`](reference/lenses/reviewing-resilience-and-scalability/body.md) ◆ — Will it survive failure and scale? Unbounded queues, timeouts and blast radius, retries, statelessness, RTO/RPO — design-time, not #16's runtime.
- [`reviewing-install-and-upgrade-experience`](reference/lenses/reviewing-install-and-upgrade-experience/body.md) ◆ — Can a consumer install, configure, and upgrade this cleanly — even hand it to an agent? Setup friction, config UX, version-bump smoothness, migration path.
