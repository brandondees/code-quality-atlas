# Open Questions & Decisions

## Decisions made

- **D1 — Project framing.** Build a *standalone, first-principles* skill suite for code review & maintenance. Existing skills/tools are prior art, not constraints. *(2026-06-08)*
- **D2 — Scope.** Maximal: intrinsic code properties **plus** all cross-cutting concerns. *(2026-06-08)*
- **D3 — Sequence.** Map first, then design the skill suite. Research/reference-gathering happens against the map before any skill design. *(2026-06-08)*
- **D4 — Repo.** `code-quality-atlas`, private, under `~/code/`. Name provisional. *(2026-06-08)*

## Open questions

### Q1 — Granularity (the big one, blocks phase 2)
24 categories is too many for 24 skills; several would be thin. How do categories collapse into a buildable, composable set? Options to weigh later:
- **By cluster** (~6 skills) — coarse, each skill covers a whole cluster.
- **By review behavior** — group by *what the reviewer does* (e.g. "trace correctness", "hunt silent failures", "check the blast radius") rather than by topic. May cut across clusters.
- **By altitude** — line/function → module → architecture → system. Maps to how reviews actually zoom.
- **Hybrid** — a few broad "lens" skills + a handful of sharp single-behavior skills (security scan, migration safety, N+1) where prior art shows crisp triggers work.
- **Decision criterion:** a skill should have a coherent trigger, fit in working context, and produce findings a human/agent can act on without re-deriving the rest of the map.

### Q2 — Candidate additions (from taxonomy.md)
Promote any of these to first-class categories? config management; logging-as-first-class; i18n money/units; licensing/compliance/provenance; **AI/LLM-specific code quality**; internal-API DX/ergonomics; portability & environment assumptions. *(AI/LLM-specific feels most likely to be genuinely under-served by all prior art.)*

### Q3 — Review vs. maintenance split
"Review" (assess a diff) and "maintenance" (improve existing code over time) are different activities that touch the same categories differently. Should skills be dual-mode, or should we have a review-facing and a maintenance-facing variant per area?

### Q4 — Findings vs. scores
Do skills emit only findings (actionable, located), or also quantitative scores per dimension (à la `type-design-analyzer`)? Scores aid trend-tracking but invite gaming/vanity-metric failure modes.

### Q5 — Counterweight enforcement
How do we make the "restraint" counterweights (premature abstraction, premature optimization) structurally present so the suite doesn't just nag for *more* — more tests, more abstraction, more defensive code? Possibly a dedicated "is this change *too much*?" lens.

### Q6 — Language/ecosystem strategy
Universal-but-shallow vs. ecosystem-specific-and-deep (the `dhh-rails` / `kieran-*` model). Likely a layered answer: language-agnostic core + opt-in idiom packs.

### Q7 — Composition & orchestration
When multiple skills apply to one review, how do they fan out and synthesize without drowning the user in overlapping findings? (Prior-art multi-agent review toolkits are the reference.)

### Q8 — Scope of "maintenance"
Does maintenance include proactive hygiene (dead-code sweeps, dependency bumps, doc staleness) on a schedule, not just review-time? If so, some skills are *cron-shaped*, not *diff-shaped*.
