## 2026-06-08 — Session 1: scoping & taxonomy v0.1

**Goal:** brainstorm what factors into code quality, as comprehensively as possible, toward a future skill suite for code review & maintenance.

**What happened:**
- Reframed mid-session: this is a **new, standalone, first-principles** suite. Existing skills are prior art, not a starting point. *(→ D1)*
- Chose **maximal scope** for the map. *(→ D2)*
- Chose to do it **phased**: comprehensive map first, then skill-suite architecture; with a research/reference-gathering loop on the map before skill design. *(→ D3)*
- Produced **taxonomy v0.1**: 6 clusters, 24 categories, ~70 factors. Embedded two counterweights (premature abstraction, premature optimization). Flagged 7 candidate additions.
- Captured everything into this repo (`code-quality-atlas`, private, under `~/code/`). *(→ D4)*
- Seeded `references.md` with foundational works + per-cluster anchors (many TODOs).
- Surveyed prior art: ~13/24 categories have some existing agent-skill coverage; identified greenfield zones and a static-analysis "heuristic goldmine" to mine.

**Open at end of session:** granularity (Q1) is the gating question for phase 2; candidate additions (Q2) pending; review-vs-maintenance, scores-vs-findings, counterweight enforcement, language strategy, composition, maintenance-scope all logged (Q3–Q8).

**Next:** continue iterating the *research* — fill `references.md` TODOs, mine static-analysis tools for concrete checks per category, resolve candidate additions — before moving to phase 2 (skill-suite architecture).
