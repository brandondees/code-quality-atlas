## 2026-06-08 — Session 1: scoping & taxonomy v0.1

**Goal:** brainstorm what factors into code quality, as comprehensively as possible, toward a future skill suite for code review & maintenance.

**What happened:**
- Reframed mid-session: this is a **new, standalone, first-principles** suite. Existing skills are prior art, not a starting point. *(→ D1)*
- Chose **maximal scope** for the map. *(→ D2)*
- Chose to do it **phased**: comprehensive map first, then skill-suite architecture; with a research/reference-gathering loop on the map before skill design. *(→ D3)*
- Produced **taxonomy v0.1**: 6 clusters, 24 categories, ~70 factors. Embedded two counterweights (premature abstraction, premature optimization). Flagged 7 candidate additions.
- Captured everything into this repo (`code-quality-atlas`, private, under `~/code/`). *(→ D4)*
- Seeded `references.md` with foundational works + per-cluster anchors (many TODOs).
- Surveyed prior art: ~13/24 categories have some existing agent-skill coverage; identified greenfield zones and a static-analysis "heuristic goldmine" to mine.

**Open at end of session:** granularity (Q1) is the gating question for phase 2; candidate additions (Q2) pending; review-vs-maintenance, scores-vs-findings, counterweight enforcement, language strategy, composition, maintenance-scope all logged (Q3–Q8).

**Next:** continue iterating the *research* — fill `references.md` TODOs, mine static-analysis tools for concrete checks per category, resolve candidate additions — before moving to phase 2 (skill-suite architecture).

### 2026-06-08 (cont.) — map pressure-test → v0.2

- Resolved all 7 candidate additions *(→ D5)*. Map now **27 categories**: added #25 AI/LLM-integration, #26 Configuration & environment, #27 Compliance/licensing/provenance; broadened #3 and #9; cross-linked #4 ↔ #23.
- Logged new open question Q9 (compliance scope boundary).
- Kicked off the parallel research pass: one research agent per cluster (references + static-analysis-tool rule mining + reviewable-heuristic seeds), output filed under `docs/research/`. Cluster I taken extra-deep as the template.

### 2026-06-08 (cont.) — research pass: web-access blocker + salvage

- **Key environment finding:** general-purpose subagents are **sandboxed without network** (WebSearch/WebFetch/curl all denied), but the **main loop has working web access**. Future research must be run from the main loop (or hand sources to subagents), not delegated to web-less subagents.
- Of 6 cluster agents: **3 correctly refused to fabricate and stopped** (I, III, V — no files); **3 wrote from-memory drafts** with `(verify)` tags + caveats (II readability, IV runtime, VI evolution). Drafts committed as **unverified v0** for safekeeping. (Cluster IV left ~15 canonical URLs unmarked — to be verified.)
- Captured cross-cutting structural findings into [`map-gaps.md`](map-gaps.md) (G1–G8): double-booked concerns needing single owners, a possible "Excessive Agency" promotion, the Clean-Code-vs-Ousterhout decomposition tension, where LLM judgment is the only tool, and git-history-shaped vs diff-shaped skills.

**Next:** redo the research properly from the main loop (where web works) — write the 3 missing clusters (I/III/V) with verified citations, and verify/upgrade the 3 drafts (clear `(verify)`, add real URLs). Cluster I first, as the exemplar.
